Feed Reader Testing
===================

## Running the application
One may run the application by downloading/cloning this entire project and opening 'index.html' in a compatible browser. The page will show the test results on the bottom after a few feed changes. It will land on the 'Udacity Blog' page when it is done testing the 7 specs.
